# Procedure for taking measurements

1. Prepare the equipment:
   - Ensure that all measuring instruments are calibrated and in good working condition.
   - Gather any additional tools or materials needed for the measurement process.

2. Set up the measurement environment:
   - Set the GPS position to the desired coordinates for the measurement, desired 1m accuracy, take the measure of base station location and verify RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) positioning if available.
   - Set frequency and bandwidth parameters according to the measurement requirements (default 60GHz) with SIVERSIMA software.
   - Verify that compass headings are accurate and consistent.
   - Test that all sensors and modules are functioning correctly, and data is being collected as expected.

3. Conduct the measurements:
   - Follow the specific procedures for each type of measurement, as outlined in the relevant documentation.
   - Record all relevant data and observations during the measurement process.
